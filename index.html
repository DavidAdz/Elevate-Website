                <h1><strong>Empowering Minds,<br>Elevating Lives</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>Having received my graduate degree in 2021, I envisioned my new found knowledge coupled with my experience as a theologian.  
                        Once my skills was harness, thus becoming vitality important. My confidence grew, and I became motivated to share with others.<br><br>
                        With the passing of time, my experience was seen as beneficial to those I come across, and 
                        I felt it was time that my services becomes available to all who may need it.<br><br>I have always believed in empowering 
                        young people to reach their full potential, by providing wholesome options for them to choose.<br><br> While everyone is not
                        academically inclined we all share emotionally, socially, cognitively psychologically and mentally the same need to 
                        becoming a better person.<br><br>I plan to use intervention programs to promote and ensuring growth mindset. 
                        While adapting to diverse learning needs, and inclusive learning of school children.<br><br> I have a vision where teachers 
                        are displaying character as positive role models, and effecting good behavior management.<br><br>This, then gives me the 
                        privilege to support families, individuals, and group to embrace counseling as a way of building up confidence to 
                        face challenges that may arise. Also, sharing the fact that we all need to feel, and be seen, 
                        be valued,and be heard.</p>
